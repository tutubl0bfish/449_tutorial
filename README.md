I added a lightmode toggle

to run
1. do the app building tutorial on the jaseci website, solely to get the installs required.
2. git clone this repo
3. do the jaseci run command from the tutorial
4. The modified code is in frontend.cl.jac and lightMode.css, there is a button that when clicked toggles a boolean that flips the css
